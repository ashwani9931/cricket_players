      Bangladesh Cricket Board's newly formed election commission head, Mohammod
      Hossain - a senior advocate of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh - said on
      Monday (September 15) that he does not believe there will be any influence
      even if Aminul Islam continues as BCB president during the election
      period. Aminul, who is currently heading the board, will contest against
      Tamim Iqbal in what is shaping up to be a political battle more than a
      cricketing one, with eyebrows raised over recent developments ahead of the
      polls. Cricbuzz earlier reported that Aminul is expected to run from Dhaka
      Division. It has since emerged that he replaced Mohammad Ashraful as a
      councillor from the division, after Ashraful did not come through the
      National Sports Council (NSC). This paved the way for Aminul's inclusion
      in the board, replacing Faruque Ahmed. Another BCB director, Nazmul
      Abedin, who entered the board via NSC, is now representing a district,
      while the two vacant NSC seats are expected to be filled by Aminul
      loyalists. The presidential election will ultimately be decided by votes
      from the 25-member board. It is understood that Aminul, backed by the
      government in his bid against Tamim, is using all his influence to retain
      his position as BCB president. Meanwhile, Tamim has called for Aminul
      (Bulbul) to step down from the presidency to ensure a level playing field.
      In an exclusive chat with Cricbuzz, chief election commissioner Hossain
      confirmed that the election will proceed as scheduled on October 4. "That
      is BCB's decision (extending deadline for submitting councillorship form).
      Our work starts after they prepare a draft list of councillors and give it
      to us. They have done that for their own official purpose. But for that
      reason, the election date will not be hampered in any way. The election
      will be on 4 October while the election process will start from September
      20," said Hossain. Asked if Aminul remaining as BCB president could impact
      the polls, he dismissed the concern. "That is his personal matter (whether
      he will stay as BCB president or not during election). Since the rule is
      that the old committee will hand over to the new committee, until the new
      committee is formed, the old committee is supposed to remain. According to
      their Articles of Association or constitution, there is no bar that the
      former president cannot contest in the new election. I do not know his
      decision personally. I am only stating the legal position, as I am a
      lawyer," he said. "You will see in any association - whether a trade
      organization or a federation - that before the election, the old committee
      does not resign. That committee remains, and the Election Commission
      conducts the election. The entire procedure of the election is in the
      hands of the Election Commission. In this process, the president or old
      committee has no function," he added, stressing that the commission holds
      "supreme power." "There won't be any interference (even if Aminul remains
      as BCB president during election) as the Election Commission continues to
      work in its own way," Hossain said. "Whoever submits valid nomination
      papers, valid voters, and are qualified to be candidates, can contest.
      There is no problem." Meanwhile, on September 14, the BCB announced an
      extension of the submission deadline for the 2025 Councilor Nomination
      Form. "Originally set for Wednesday, 17 September 2025, the new deadline
      is now Friday, 19 September 2025. All concerned parties are requested to
      take note of the revised date and ensure timely submissions," BCB said in
      a statement.
